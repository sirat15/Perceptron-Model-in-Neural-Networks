# Perceptron-Model-in-Neural-Networks

This repository holds the learning activity from the course **Pytorch for Deep Learning and Computer Viso** on Udemy.

Perceptron model is created sklearn.
## Libraries Used
-pyTorch
-Numpy
-Matplotlib
-sklearn

### Testing two points (1, -1) and (-1,1)
red point should have probability close to 1 and black point should have it close to 0
